# Dependancy-of-plasma-level-of-a-polyamine-on-age

In a medical study, researchers collected measurements from 25 young children. Of interest is the dependency of the plasma level of a polyamine on age.

## Obejctive :
- Fit a simple linear regression model and analyze the residual plots.
-	What is the expected change in the plasma level if the age of the children is increased by 1 year?
-	Use Box cox transformation to choose appropriate value of λ.
-	Fit a simple linear regression model after transformation.
-	Compare and contrast models in (a) and (d)
